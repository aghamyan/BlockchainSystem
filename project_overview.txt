Project Overview
----------------
This repository contains two small Java demos:
1) A minimal blockchain simulation that shows how proof of work, blocks, and transactions fit together.
2) A key predistribution system (KPS) that demonstrates how a trusted server can hand out starting secrets so users can derive shared keys later without contacting the server again.

Both demos are designed for learning and experimentation, not production use. They favor readability and simple control flows over performance or security hardening.
