Blockchain Demo (Plain-Language Guide)
-------------------------------------
Goal: Show a tiny proof-of-work blockchain where nodes exchange transactions, mine blocks, and keep a shared ledger in sync.

Core ideas
- Transactions: Each payment records sender, recipient, amount, and a signature proving the sender authorized it.
- Blocks: Batches of transactions linked together by hashes, forming an ordered chain.
- Proof of work: Miners search for a nonce that makes the block hash start with a target number of zeros. This prevents easy tampering.
- Nodes: Full nodes hold the ledger, share transactions/blocks with peers, and mine new blocks.

How the demo flows
1) DemoMain builds three full nodes and connects them together.
2) A client generates keys, signs a transaction, writes it to disk, and submits it to one node.
3) Nodes gossip the transaction, a miner finds a valid nonce, and the resulting block is appended to the ledger.
4) When a block lands, nodes notify listeners so the client knows its transaction was confirmed.

Key classes (in com.example.blockchain)
- Block: Holds transaction IDs, previous hash, nonce, and computed hash.
- Transaction: Represents a signed payment and can verify its own signature.
- Ledger: Stores the ordered chain and checks new blocks for valid hashes and linkage.
- FullNode: Combines a ledger with networking-style helpers to share transactions/blocks and trigger mining.
- ProofOfWorkMiner: Brute-forces the nonce to satisfy the difficulty target.
- Client: Generates keys, constructs and signs transactions, and listens for confirmations.

Why this matters
By running the demo you can see the essential pieces of many cryptocurrencies—digital signatures, chained hashes, and proof of work—without needing a large network or external dependencies.
